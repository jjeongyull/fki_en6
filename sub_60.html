          From a Single Briquette to 70 Years of Energy
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          On October 1, 1955, co-founders Seong-yeon Yoo and Jang-kyun Yi established Samchully Briquette Company. The small spark lit in that modest briquette factory grew into a guiding light for Korea’s energy industry over the next 70 years.<br>
          In the 1970s, Samchully ranked first in Seoul’s briquette market, at a time when coal briquettes “fuelled the nation”. In the 1980s, the energy paradigm shifted, and the company moved decisively into the city gas business. In 1987, Samchully became the first company in Korea to supply LNG, opening the era of LNG-based city gas.<br>
          Through aggressive pipeline expansion, rigorous safety management, and proactive technology development, Samchully has grown into Korea’s largest city gas company. Today, it supplies approximately 3.35 million customers across 13 cities in Gyeonggi Province and 5 districts in Incheon, delivering about 3.8 billion cubic meters of city gas annually through a pipeline network exceeding 8,000 ㎞, with stable revenues from a balanced demand structure across industrial and residential users.<br>
          In the 2000s, Samchully once again embraced change. By expanding into district energy and power generation, the group evolved into a comprehensive energy provider supplying city gas, heat, and electricity. Its subsidiary HUCES, a specialist in district heating and power supply, along with the Samchully Gwangmyeong Combined Heat and Power Plant and Ansan Urban Development, delivers district heating services. In parallel, private power producer S-Power operates LNG-based combined-cycle power plants, contributing to the stability of the metropolitan power grid.<br>
          At the same time, Samchully is actively adopting environmentally friendly technologies in response to the carbon-neutral era. Samchully ES provides sustainable energy solutions through fuel cell construction, with the largest cumulative installed capacity in Korea at 511 MW, and the deployment of high-efficiency gas heat pumps (GHPs)<span class="sub-tool">1</span>. The company is also expanding resource circulation businesses that utilize waste heat.

        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Having grown into a leading energy specialist, Samchully has expanded its horizons beyond the energy sector, building on its accumulated technological expertise and customer trust. The group’s “Life & Culture” segment has emerged as a new growth pillar, encompassing dining, automotive dealerships, and overseas businesses in food service and hospitality.<br>
          SL&C, which leads Samchully’s dining business, operates more than 70 outlets nationwide across five brands spanning Korean, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine. Key brands include the modern Chinese restaurant Chai797, the Hong Kong-style casual dining brand HAO'SUM, the premium Korean beef sirloin specialist Just Butchers, the open-flame grill restaurant Seorijae, and the traditional Edomae-style sushi restaurant Itamae Sushi. In addition, Samchully has entered the restaurant meal replacement market through Samchully Misikgwan, expanding a dining ecosystem that integrates both online and offline channels.<br>
          Samchully Motors operates as an official BMW dealer, running new car showrooms and service centers across the Seoul metropolitan area and the Chungcheong region, while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. At the same time, Samchully EV has entered the domestic market as the official Korean dealer for global electric vehicle brand BYD, extending the group’s footprint into the eco-friendly mobility sector.<br>
          Samchully is also strengthening its global business base through hotel operations and restaurant brand expansion in the United States. Following the Japanese dining brand Robata Wasa, the group launched the Korean cuisine brand KSC, short for Kalbi Social Club, introducing Korean culinary culture to local customers and contributing to the global spread of K-Food.
