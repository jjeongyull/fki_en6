          A platform for shared growth has been created to support the development of small businesses and expand their online sales channels. In partnership with the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and the Small Enterprise and Market Service, FKI hosted the WE! Partners Fair, bringing together major domestic and global platform companies to help small businesses take a meaningful step toward global markets.

        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          The overall environment for small businesses has continued to deteriorate, according to the Small Business Conditions Survey (1,000 respondents) conducted by FKI during preparations for the town hall summit associated with the fair. The survey found that 77.1% of respondents, or nearly eight out of ten small business owners, expected their sales in 2025 to be similar to or lower than in 2024. In response to these challenges and in an effort to open new growth pathways, FKI organized the WE! Partners Fair together with the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and the Small Enterprise and Market Service.<br>
          A defining feature of the fair was its focus on direct engagement not only with domestic platforms, but also with leading global platform companies. Alongside NAVER and Kakao, major international e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Shopee participated, enabling small businesses and prospective entrepreneurs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the preparation required to enter global markets.<br>
          On the first day of the event, a K-Small Business Town Hall Meeting was held with the participation of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, the Small Enterprise and Market Service, FKI, platform companies, and representatives of small businesses. The session focused on policy directions and support measures needed to build a sustainable growth ladder for small businesses.

          A Hands-On Shared Growth Program
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          The fair went beyond information sharing to offer hands-on consultation and experiential programs, allowing small business owners to learn through direct participation. Platform-specific onboarding consultations and the sharing of operational know-how provided practical strategies even for businesses with no prior experience in overseas sales. Shopee, which operates as a leading e-commerce platform across seven Southeast Asian countries, offered entry consultations for small businesses seeking to expand into the region.<br>
          An AI Zone was set up to allow participants to gain hands-on experience with features essential in online sales, including product photography and automated image enhancement, customer review analysis insights, and online advertising performance forecasting using platform-based AI technologies. The opportunity to directly engage with digital tools and assess their potential impact on overall business operations was a key highlight of the event.<br>
          To further support sales, the organizers provided consumer coupons and prizes, boosting on-site engagement. The integrated consultation, experience, and sales programs provided a practical opportunity to strengthen the online capabilities of participating small businesses.

          The fair highlighted the growing potential for Korean small businesses to enter global markets through online platforms. FKI hopes that the event will serve as a stepping stone for small businesses to develop into global power sellers, and plans to continue expanding support programs to assist Korean small businesses. FKI expresses its hopes that such events will function as a key link in connecting small businesses to global markets, helping transform new challenges into broader opportunities.
