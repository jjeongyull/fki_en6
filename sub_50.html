                      <div class="swiper-txt">The government and the Democratic Party of Korea agreed to abolish the breach of trust offense, 72 years after its enactment. Previously, executives could face criminal sanctions if losses arising in the ordinary course of management ultimately resulted in a loss to the company, whereas in common law jurisdictions, civil liability typically serves as the primary remedy. The past Korean framework has long been criticized as a constraint on business that discourages creative innovation. With its abolition, the government and the ruling party plan to introduce substitute legislation that categorizes breach of trust by type. At the same time, 441 provisions will be converted, imposing administrative fines and similar measures rather than imprisonment. This aims to enhance managerial autonomy and reduce uncertainty stemming from judicial risk.</div>

Under the agreement, market access was expanded for Korea’s key export items, including automobiles, steel, and chemicals, while additional liberalization of agricultural and fisheries products was excluded. The two sides also agreed to strengthen cooperation in defense (including the FA-50 program), infrastructure development, and energy transition.

This reflects a compromise on the size and structure of a U.S.-focused investment fund, which was the most challenging issue in the talks. Korea will deploy direct cash investments totaling USD 200 billion over a period of ten years or more as part of a USD 350 billion investment fund, but to prevent abrupt capital outflows, annual contributions will be capped at USD 20 billion, with safeguard provisions for adjustments to the payment schedule to reflect foreign exchange market conditions. The agreement is expected to significantly improve the export environment for Korean companies in the U.S. market.</div>

In September, the current account posted a record surplus with stronger semiconductor exports driven by demand for high-performance AI applications, while trade uncertainty eased between Korea and the United States. The Bank of Korea expects to see 1%-range growth in 2025 and sees potential for 2%-range growth in 2026 as export momentum and a recovery in domestic demand converge. Major global investment banks have likewise maintained a positive outlook, forecasting growth of around 1.9%, but have also indicated that high exchange rate and weakness in the construction sector are key variables.</div>

According to an analysis by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the United States added 229 unicorns after the COVID-19 pandemic, while Korea added only 2. The average time required for Korean companies to reach unicorn status was 8.99 years, longer than the 6.97-year average among the top 10 countries. Global unicorns are concentrated in the AI and IT industries, but Korea showed a heavy concentration in the consumer goods and distribution (46.1%) industries, highlighting structural limits in growth speed and industrial diversification. Regulatory burdens and limited access to global capital were cited as key constraints on the growth of innovative firms.</div>

Facility investment rose by 2.6% and exports increased by 2.1%, while construction investment, which had remained sluggish for an extended period, rebounded with a 0.6% increase.

Unveiling the K-Semiconductor Vision, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy revealed plans to strengthen fabless design capabilities while maintaining memory semiconductor leadership. To support domestic fabless firms and create co-prosperity, a dedicated foundry facility valued at KRW 4.5 trillion will be established by 2028. The vision also provides concentrated investment in next-generation memory, AI semiconductors and advanced packaging, and will promote Korea’s technological self-reliance, introducing a preferential procurement system for domestically produced chips in critical national security infrastructure. At the same time, the vision aims to strengthen the broader industrial ecosystem by developing a southern innovation belt and cultivating globally competitive companies in materials, components and equipment.</div>

Survey results show that while their electricity usage rose 0.8% year on year, electricity costs increased by about 12.7%, or more than KRW 1.814 trillion. This reflects cumulative rate hikes of roughly 70% over the past three and a half years and electricity rates for large corporations being set at more than 30% above cost to offset losses at the national power utility. These have prompted concerns that production may be suspended or some operations relocated overseas, or that some firms may respond by making direct power purchases.</div>

Despite external uncertainties such as U.S. tariffs, a strong semiconductor performance driven by the AI boom, coupled with solid results in automobiles and shipbuilding, helped Korea reach this milestone. The emergence of new growth drivers including food and cosmetics, and the increased diversification of export destinations are also helping. Foreign direct investment also recorded a historic high of USD 35 billion, led by greenfield investment in advanced industries. However, remaining challenges for the Korean economy include reducing its heavy reliance on specific export items and strengthening the export capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises.</div>

                          <div class="swiper-txt">Korea’s stock market ended 2025 with the KOSPI above the 4,210 mark, closing out an annual percentage gain of 75.6 - the highest among major global markets. This is largely considered the result of government stimulus measures and the semiconductor supercycle. Shares of major semiconductor companies led the rally, with Samsung Electronics rising by 125% and SK Hynix climbing 270%, opening the doors to the era of a KRW 3,000 trillion market capitalization. The KOSDAQ index also gained 37%, closing at 925.47, fueling expectations that the 1,000-point milestone can soon be reached.</div>
