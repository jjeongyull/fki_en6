                VISION 2045 Unveiled in Celebration of 80th Anniversary Advancing Toward the Next 100 Years
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                In October, Hanjin Group celebrated its 80th anniversary with a commemorative event reflecting on its achievements and outlining its future vision. Founded in 1945 as Hanjin Trading Company, the Group has played a central role in the development of Korea’s logistics industry. Guided by its founding philosophy of “contributing to the community through transportation,” Hanjin has grown into a global leader in aviation and logistics.<br>
                At the ceremony, Walter Cho, Chairman and CEO of Hanjin Group, expressed his gratitude, emphasizing that the trust of customers and employee dedication have been the driving forces behind the Group’s growth.<br>
                On the same occasion, Emily Cho, President and CMO of Hanjin Logistics Corporation, announced the Group’s vision, “Moving the World to a Better Future,” along with its long-term roadmap, “VISION 2045.” The vision outlines seven key strategic priorities: evolve into an integrated mobility solutions provider across aerospace, future mobility and e-commerce; lead lo- gistics technology innovation through AI-based Hyper-Autonomous Logi-Tech; build sustainable space logistics solutions leveraging expertise in defense and space launch technologies; deliver a premier transport and logistics experience through digital transformation powered by advanced IT and AI; create new value across tourism, hospitality, and real estate through aviation-logistics synergy; expand investment in talent development to cultivate global logistics experts; advance ESG leadership through Creating Shared Value (CSV) and community initiatives for sustainable growth. Together, these pillars aim to position Hanjin Group as a leading global integrated logistics group.<br>
                Rather than a one-time celebration, the anniversary event focused on conveying appreciation to employees and customers. Hanjin Group reaffirmed its belief that the essence of transportation lies connecting people, and pledged to continue growing alongside society as a global logistics group admired worldwide in the years ahead.

                Kia’s 80-Year Journey of Challenge and Determination History Revisited, Future Vision Revealed
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                Kia marked its 80th anniversary with a commemorative event attended by approximately 400 employees and distinguished guests, unveiling both a comprehensive corporate history volume titled Kia: 80 Years and its future concept car, Vision Meta Turismo.<br>
                Kia: 80 Years is the first official company history published since Kia joined Hyundai Motor Group. The book retraces eight decades of the company’s journey, from its founding as Kyungsung Precision Industry in 1944 to the eras of three-wheeled vehicles, passenger cars, and today’s electric vehicles and PBVs. The narrative is framed around the spirit of taking on challenges and perseverance that has defined Kia’s evolution. It also highlights the management philosophies of successive leaders, including founder Cheol-ho Kim’s commitment to technological nation building, Honorary Chairman Mong-koo Chung’s focus on quality and global management, and Chairman Eui-sun Chung’s emphasis on design-driven innovation.<br>
                Kia also revealed its next generation concept car, Vision Meta Turismo, which presents the brand’s vision for future mobility. The model offers an immersive driving experience through AR HUD based modes such as Speedster, Dreamer, and Gamer, reflecting Kia’s direction toward future mobility experiences where technology and emotion are closely integrated.<br>
                An exhibition titled The Legacy of Movement was held alongside the event, offering a concise view of Kia’s history. Seventeen vehicles were on display, ranging from Korea’s first domestically produced bicycle, the Samchuly Bicycle to iconic auto models such as the Sportage and Carnival. The exhibition was organized into eight thematic zones, visually tracing Kia’s journey from its founding spirit to its global expansion. The exhibition will remain open through 2029, with special programs for the general public to be introduced in the future.<br>
                To further commemorate its 80th anniversary, Kia has launched a heritage asset discovery and collection campaign titled Kia Treasure Hunt: In Search of 80 Years of Legacy.<br>
                Kia plans to release archival materials covering its 80-year history and vehicle lineup through an online platform called Movement Archive. In addition, a video campaign titled The Portraits of Kia will be rolled out, reinterpreting the brand’s journey through the perspectives of diverse individuals.

                “Samyang 1963” Marks Samyang’s First Beef-Tallow Ramen in 36 Years
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                Samyang Foods unveiled its new premium ramen product, Samyang 1963, at voco Seoul Myeongdong in Jung-gu, Seoul, in November, while also presenting its next generation ramen strategy that reinterprets the original Samyang Ramen recipe through a modern lens. The launch was especially meaningful as it coincided with the 36th anniversary of the lard incident, underscoring the company’s commitment to preserving brand authenticity and its philosophy of “true taste.”<br>
                Samyang 1963 features beef tallow, once a core ingredient in the original Samyang Ramen, to enhance the richness of the noodles and the depth of the broth. The noodles are fried in a “golden blend oil” combining animal-based beef tallow and plant-based palm oil to elevate flavor, additional ingredients include beef bone broth, radish, green onion, and Cheongyang chili pepper to deliver a spicy yet clean finish. Jung-soo Kim, Vice Chairman of Samyang Foods, stated that while the company has grown into a global food enterprise sharing Korean culinary culture with the world, it is now embarking on another chapter of innovation.
